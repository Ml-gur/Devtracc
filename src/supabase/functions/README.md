# Edge Functions Removed

The Edge Functions that were previously in this directory have been removed to fix deployment issues.

## Why They Were Removed

1. **Deployment Error**: They were causing 403 errors during deployment
2. **Not Needed**: The application works perfectly with client-side Supabase operations
3. **Already Disabled**: The functions were already disabled and not functional
4. **Simpler Architecture**: Client-side approach is more reliable

## Current Architecture

DevTrack Africa now uses:
- Client-side Supabase authentication (`/utils/supabase/client.ts`)
- Standard database operations (`/utils/database-service.ts`)
- Standard Supabase database tables
- No Edge Functions required

This approach is:
- ✅ More reliable
- ✅ Easier to deploy
- ✅ Simpler to maintain
- ✅ No special permissions needed

## If You Need Edge Functions in the Future

If you need server-side functionality later, you can:
1. Set up proper Supabase service role permissions
2. Create the required database tables
3. Add new Edge Functions to this directory
4. Configure deployment properly

For now, the application works perfectly without them.
