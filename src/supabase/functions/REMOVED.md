# Edge Functions Removed

All Edge Functions have been removed to resolve deployment issues.

## Why Removed

- Causing 403 deployment errors
- Not needed for application functionality
- App uses client-side Supabase operations

## Current Architecture

DevTrack Africa now uses:
- ✅ Client-side authentication
- ✅ Standard database operations
- ✅ No server-side functions required
- ✅ Simplified deployment

This approach is more reliable and deploys without permission issues.
