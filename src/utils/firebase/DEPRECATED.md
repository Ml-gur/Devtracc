# Firebase Files Completely Removed

This directory contained deprecated Firebase files that have been completely replaced with Supabase equivalents and are no longer needed.

The application now uses:
- `/utils/supabase/auth-client.ts` for authentication
- `/utils/supabase/connection-manager.ts` for connection management  
- `/utils/supabase/client.ts` for all database operations

All Firebase dependencies have been completely removed from the application.

DevTrack Africa is now 100% powered by Supabase with no Firebase traces remaining.
