# DevTrack Africa Database Setup Instructions

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Steps

Now that you've connected to Supabase, follow these steps to set up your database:

### 1. Access Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**

### 2. Run the Database Setup Script
1. Copy the entire contents of `/database-setup.sql` from this project
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** to execute the script

### 3. Verify Setup
After running the script, you should see:
- âœ… Tables created: `users`, `projects`, `tasks`, `posts`
- âœ… Row Level Security enabled
- âœ… Policies configured for proper access control

### 4. Test Database Connection
1. Go back to your DevTrack Africa app
2. Try creating a new project
3. The "Database setup required" error should be resolved

## ðŸ“‹ What the Script Creates

### Tables:
- **users**: User profiles and authentication data
- **projects**: Project information and metadata
- **tasks**: Kanban board tasks with status tracking
- **posts**: Community feed posts and updates

### Security:
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Policies for public read access
- User-specific write permissions
- Project creator permissions for tasks

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If you see permission errors:
1. Make sure you're logged into Supabase with the project owner account
2. Check that RLS is properly configured
3. Verify your environment variables are correct

### If tables already exist:
The script uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` so it's safe to run multiple times.

### Alternative Setup:
If the main script fails, there's also `/database-setup-alternative.sql` with a slightly different approach.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

Once the database is set up:
1. âœ… Create your first project
2. âœ… Add tasks to the Kanban board
3. âœ… Share progress updates
4. âœ… Explore the community feed

The app is now fully functional with persistent data storage!
